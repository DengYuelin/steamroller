# Steamroller Extruder
This is a work in progress! Use at own risk!

## TLDR
The Steamroller extruder is a Voron Clockwork, modified to hold an OMG Extruder. In the STL folder, print only the files starting with steamroller. The others are of a single "block" made from the original Clockwork. The block became the starting point for the Steamroller.

I don't have a donate button. However, if you order the OMG with one of the affiliate links, you won't pay more and a small comission will go to this project. Thank you!
