# Steamroller Extruder
Not ready for prime time, this is a work in progress! Use at own risk! Right now, there's an issue with the fit between the Clockwork and the hotend housing. Workin' it, will update here when fixed.

## TLDR
The Steamroller extruder is a Voron Clockwork, modified to hold an OMG Extruder. In the STL folder, print only the files starting with steamroller. The others are of a single "block" made from the original Clockwork. The block became the starting point for the Steamroller.
